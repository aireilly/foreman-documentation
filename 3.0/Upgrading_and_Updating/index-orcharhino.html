<h3 id="upgrading_prerequisites">1.1. Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading to orcharhino 5.9 affects your entire orcharhino infrastructure.
Before proceeding, complete the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the orcharhino 5.9 Release Notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review this guide so that you are aware of the upgrade process and its impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan your upgrade path.
For more information, see <a href="#upgrade_paths">Upgrade Paths</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for the required downtime. orcharhino services are shut down during the upgrade.
The upgrade process duration might vary depending on your hardware configuration, network speed, and the amount of data that is stored on the server.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino takes approximately 1 - 2 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino Proxy takes approximately 10 - 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have sufficient storage space on your server.
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/3.0/Installing_Server_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino server from a Connected Network</em> and <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/3.0/Installing_Proxy_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-capsule-installation">Preparing your Environment for Installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino Proxy</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up your orcharhino server and all orcharhino Proxys.

</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for updating any scripts you use that contain orcharhino API commands because some API commands differ between versions of orcharhino.
For more information about changes in the API, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/4396911">API Changes Between orcharhino Versions</a> on the Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal.</p>

If you customize configuration files, manually or use a tool such as Hiera, these customizations are overwritten when the installation script runs during upgrading or updating.
You can use the <code>--noop</code> option with the foreman-installer script to test for changes.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade to orcharhino 5.9 from orcharhino 5.8.
orcharhino servers and orcharhino Proxys on earlier versions must first be upgraded to orcharhino 5.8.
For more information, see the orcharhino 5.8 Upgrade documentation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Overview of orcharhino 5.9 Upgrade Paths</div>
<p>The high level steps in upgrading to orcharhino 5.9 are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Upgrade orcharhino server and all orcharhino Proxys to orcharhino 5.9.
For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_satellite_server_parent">Upgrading orcharhino server</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade to orcharhino client on all orcharhino clients.
For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_clients">[upgrading_clients]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="following_the_progress_of_the_upgrade">1.3. Following the Progress of the Upgrade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the lengthy upgrade time, use a utility such as <code>screen</code> to suspend and reattach a communication session.
You can then check the upgrade progress without staying connected to the command shell continuously.
For more information about using the screen command, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5247">How do I use the screen command?</a> article in the <em>Red&#160;Hat Knowledge&#160;Base</em>.
You can also see the <code>screen</code> manual page for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you lose connection to the command shell where the upgrade command is running you can see the logs in <code>/var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code> to check if the process completed successfully.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">1.4. Upgrading orcharhino Proxies Separately from orcharhino</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can upgrade orcharhino to the version 5.9 and keep orcharhino Proxies at the version 5.8 until you have bandwidth to upgrade them too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the functionality that worked previously works on 5.8 orcharhino Proxies.
However, the functionality added in the 5.9 release will not work until you upgrade orcharhino Proxies to 5.9.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrading orcharhino Proxies after upgrading orcharhino can be useful in the following example scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If you want to have several smaller outage windows instead of one larger window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If orcharhino Proxies in your organization are managed by several teams and are located in different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a load-balanced configuration, you can upgrade one load-balanced orcharhino Proxy and keep other load-balanced orcharhino Proxies at one version lower.
This allows you to upgrade all orcharhino Proxies one after another without any outage.</p>

You can upgrade from any minor version of orcharhino server 5.8.</p>

For more information, see <a href="#upgrading_capsules-separately-from-satellite_upgrade-guide">Upgrading orcharhino Proxies Separately from orcharhino</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and update your firewall configuration prior to upgrading your orcharhino server.
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/3.0/Installing_Server_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation">Preparing your environment for installation</a> in <em>Installing orcharhino server</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you do not delete the manifest from the Customer Portal or in the orcharhino management UI because this removes all the entitlements of your content hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back up and remove all Foreman hooks before upgrading.
Restore any hooks only after orcharhino is known to be working after the upgrade is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have edited any of the default templates, back up the files either by cloning or exporting them.
Cloning is the recommended method because that prevents them being overwritten in future updates or upgrades.
To confirm if a template has been edited, you can view its <strong>History</strong> before you upgrade or view the changes in the audit log after an upgrade.
In the orcharhino management UI, navigate to <strong>Monitor</strong> &gt; <strong>Audits</strong> and search for the template to see a record of changes made.
If you use the export method, restore your changes by comparing the exported template and the default template, manually applying your changes.</p>

<p>If you use Content Views to control updates to a orcharhino Proxy’s base operating system, or for orcharhino Proxy repository, you must publish updated versions of those Content Views.</p>

<p>Note that orcharhino server upgraded from 5.8 to 5.9 can use orcharhino Proxys still at 5.8.</p>
