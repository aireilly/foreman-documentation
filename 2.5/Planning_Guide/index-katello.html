<p><em>Foreman</em> is a system management solution that enables you to deploy, configure, and maintain your systems across physical, virtual, and cloud environments.
Foreman provides provisioning, remote management and monitoring of multiple Red&#160;Hat Enterprise Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.
<em>Foreman Server</em> synchronizes the content from Red&#160;Hat Customer&#160;Portal and other sources, and provides functionality including fine-grained life cycle management, user and group role-based access control, integrated subscription management, as well as advanced GUI, CLI, or API access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Foreman Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server</em> mirrors content from Foreman Server to facilitate content federation across various geographical locations.
Host systems can pull content and configuration from Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server in their location and not from the central Foreman&#160;server.
Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server also provides localized services such as Puppet Master, DHCP, DNS, or TFTP.
Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers assist you in scaling your Foreman environment as the number of your managed systems increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers decrease the load on the central server, increase redundancy, and reduce bandwidth usage.

<p>There are four stages through which content flows in this architecture:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>External Content Sources</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>Foreman Server</em> can consume diverse types of content from various sources.
The Red&#160;Hat Customer Portal is the primary source of software packages, errata, and container images.
In addition, you can use other supported content sources (Git repositories, Docker Hub, Puppet Forge, SCAP repositories) as well as your organization&#8217;s internal data store.</p>

<p>The Foreman Server enables you to plan and manage the content life cycle and the configuration of Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers and hosts through GUI, CLI, or API.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foreman&#160;server organizes the life cycle management by using organizations as principal division units.
Organizations isolate content for groups of hosts with specific requirements and administration tasks.
For example, the OS build team can use a different organization than the web development team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foreman&#160;server also contains a fine-grained authentication system to provide Foreman operators with permissions to access precisely the parts of the infrastructure that lie in their area of responsibility.</p>

<dd>
<p>Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers mirror content from Foreman&#160;server to establish content sources in various geographical locations.
This enables host systems to pull content and configuration from Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers in their location and not from the central Foreman&#160;server.
The recommended minimum number of Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers is therefore given by the number of geographic regions where the organization that uses Foreman operates.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using Content Views, you can specify the exact subset of content that Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server makes available to hosts.
See <a href="#figu-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Red_Hat_Satellite_6_System_Architecture-Content_Life_Cycle_in_Red_Hat_Satellite_6">Content Life Cycle in Foreman</a> for a closer look at life cycle management with the use of Content Views.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The communication between managed hosts and Foreman&#160;server is routed through Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server that can also manage multiple services on behalf of hosts.
Many of these services use dedicated network ports, but Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server ensures that a single source IP address is used for all communications from the host to Foreman&#160;server, which simplifies firewall administration.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, each organization has a Library of content from external sources.
Content Views are subsets of content from the Library created by intelligent filtering.
You can publish and promote Content Views into life cycle environments (typically Dev, QA, and Production).
When creating a Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server, you can choose which life cycle environments will be copied to that Smart&#160;Proxy and made available to managed hosts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Content Views can be combined to create Composite Content Views.
It can be beneficial to have a separate Content View for a repository of packages required by an operating system and a separate one for a repository of packages required by an application.
One advantage is that any updates to packages in one repository only requires republishing the relevant Content View.
You can then use Composite Content Views to combine published Content Views for ease of management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which Content Views should be promoted to which Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server depends on the Smart&#160;Proxy&#8217;s intended functionality.
Any Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server can run DNS, DHCP, and TFTP as infrastructure services that can be supplemented, for example, with content or configuration services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can update Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server by creating a new version of a Content View using synchronized content from the Library.
The new Content View version is then promoted through life cycle environments.
You can also create in-place updates of Content Views.
This means creating a minor version of the Content View in its current life cycle environment without promoting it from the Library.
For example, if you need to apply a security erratum to a Content View used in Production, you can update the Content View directly without promoting to other life cycles.

<p>Foreman takes a consolidated approach to Organization and Location management.
System administrators define multiple Organizations and multiple Locations in a single Foreman&#160;server.
For example, a company might have three Organizations (Finance, Marketing, and Sales) across three countries (United States, United Kingdom, and Japan).
In this example, Foreman&#160;server manages all Organizations across all geographical Locations, creating nine distinct contexts for managing systems.
In addition, users can define specific locations and nest them to create a hierarchy.
For example, Foreman administrators might divide the United States into specific cities, such as Boston, Phoenix, or San Francisco.</p>

<h2 id="chap-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Host_Grouping_Concepts">4. Host Grouping Concepts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from the physical topology of Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers, Foreman provides several logical units for grouping hosts.
Hosts that are members of those groups inherit the group configuration.
For example, the simple parameters that define the provisioning environment can be applied at the following levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap">Global &gt; Organization &gt; Location &gt; Domain &gt; Host group &gt; Host</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main logical groups in Foreman are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizations</strong> – the highest level logical groups for hosts.
Organizations provide a strong separation of content and configuration.
Each organization requires a separate Subscription Manifest, and can be thought of as a separate virtual instance of a Foreman&#160;server.
Avoid the use of organizations if a lower level host grouping is applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locations</strong> – a grouping of hosts that should match the physical location.
Locations can be used to map the network infrastructure to prevent incorrect host placement or configuration.
For example, you cannot assign a subnet, domain, or compute resources directly to a Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server, only to a location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host groups</strong> – the main carriers of host definitions including assigned Puppet classes, Content View, or operating system.
Find the complete list of host group parameters in <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/puppet_guide/chap-red_hat_satellite-puppet_guide-adding_puppet_modules_to_red_hat_satellite_6#sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Puppet_Guide-Adding_Puppet_Modules_to_Red_Hat_Satellite_6-Parameters">Parameters</a> in the <em>Puppet Guide</em>.
It is recommended to configure the majority of settings at the host group level instead of defining hosts directly.
Configuring a new host then largely becomes a matter of adding it to the right host group.
As host groups can be nested, you can create a structure that best fits your requirements (see <a href="#sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Host_Group_Hierarchies">Host Group Structures</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host collections</strong> – a host registered to Foreman&#160;server for the purpose of subscription and content management is called <strong>content host</strong>.
Content hosts can be organized into host collections, which enables performing bulk actions such as package management or errata installation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Locations and host groups can be nested, organizations and host collections are flat.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Host_Group_Hierarchies">4.1. Host Group Structures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that host groups can be nested to inherit parameters from each other allows for designing host group hierarchies that fit particular workflows.
A well planned host group structure can help to simplify the maintenance of host settings.
This section outlines four approaches to organizing host groups.</p>

</div>
<div id="brid-Flat_Structure" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Flat Structure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of a flat structure is limited complexity, as inheritance is avoided.
In a deployment with few host types, this scenario is the best option.
However, without inheritance there is a risk of high duplication of settings between host groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="brid-Life_Cycle_Environment_Based_Structure" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Life Cycle Environment Based Structure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this hierarchy, the first host group level is reserved for parameters specific to a life cycle environment.
The second level contains operating system related definitions, and the third level contains application specific settings.
Such structure is useful in scenarios where responsibilities are divided among life cycle environments (for example, a dedicated owner for the <strong>Development</strong>, <strong>QA</strong>, and <strong>Production</strong> life cycle stages).</p>
</div>
<div id="brid-Flat_Host_Group_Structure" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Application Based Structure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This hierarchy is based on roles of hosts in a specific application.
For example, it enables defining network settings for groups of back-end and front-end servers.
The selected characteristics of hosts are segregated, which supports Puppet-focused management of complex configurations.
However, the content views can only be assigned to host groups at the bottom level of this hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div id="brid-Location_Based_Structure" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Location Based Structure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this hierarchy, the distribution of locations is aligned with the host group structure.
In a scenario where the location (Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server) topology determines many other attributes, this approach is the best option.
On the other hand, this structure complicates sharing parameters across locations, therefore in complex environments with a large number of applications, the number of host group changes required for each configuration change increases significantly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important feature of Foreman is unattended provisioning of hosts.
To achieve this, Foreman uses DNS and DHCP infrastructures, PXE booting, TFTP, and Kickstart.

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pxe_booting">5.1. PXE Booting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Preboot execution environment (PXE) provides the ability to boot a system over a network.
Instead of using local hard drives or a CD-ROM, PXE uses DHCP to provide host with standard information about the network, to discover a TFTP server, and to download a boot image.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pxe_sequence">5.1.1. PXE Sequence</h4>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The host boots the PXE image if no other bootable image is found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A NIC of the host sends a broadcast request to the DHCP server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DHCP server receives the request and sends standard information about the network: IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, the location of a TFTP server, and a boot image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The host obtains the boot loader <code>image/pxelinux.0</code> and the configuration file <code>pxelinux.cfg/00:MA:CA:AD:D</code> from the TFTP server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The host configuration specifies the location of a kernel image, <code>initrd</code> and Kickstart.</p>

<p>When you install Foreman, the <code>foreman-installer</code> command creates databases on the same server that you install Foreman.
Depending on your requirements, moving to external databases can provide increased working memory for Foreman, which can improve response times for database operating requests.
Moving to external databases distributes the workload and can increase the capacity for performance tuning.</p>

<p>Consider using external databases if you plan to use your Foreman deployment for the following scenarios:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Frequent remote execution tasks.
This creates a high volume of records in PostgreSQL and generates heavy database workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High disk I/O workloads from frequent repository synchronization or Content View publishing.
This causes Foreman to create a record in PostgreSQL for each job.</p>

<p>This section outlines general considerations that should help you to specify your Foreman deployment scenario.

The defining questions are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How many Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers do I need?</strong> – The number of geographic locations where your organization operates should translate to the number of Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers.
By assigning a Smart&#160;Proxy to each location, you decrease the load on Foreman&#160;server, increase redundancy, and reduce bandwidth usage.
Foreman&#160;server itself can act as a Smart&#160;Proxy (it contains an integrated Smart&#160;Proxy by default).
This can be used in single location deployments and to provision the base system&#8217;s of Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers.
Using the integrated Smart&#160;Proxy to communicate with hosts in remote locations is not recommended as it can lead to suboptimal network utilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What services will be provided by Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers?</strong> – After establishing the number of Smart&#160;Proxies, decide what services will be enabled on each Smart&#160;Proxy.
Even though the whole stack of content and configuration management capabilities is available, some infrastructure services (DNS, DHCP, TFTP) can be outside of a Foreman administrator&#8217;s control.
In such case, Smart&#160;Proxies have to integrate with those external services (see <a href="#Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_with_External_Services">Smart&#160;Proxy with External Services</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What compute resources do I need for my hosts?</strong> – Apart from provisioning bare metal hosts, you can use various compute resources supported by Foreman.
To learn about provisioning on different compute resources see the <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Provisioning_Guide/index-foreman-el.html#"><em>Provisioning Guide</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id="sect-Defining_Content_Sources">6.3. Content Sources</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Subscription Manifest determines what Red&#160;Hat repositories are accessible from your Foreman&#160;server.
Once you enable a Red&#160;Hat repository, an associated Foreman Product is created automatically.
For distributing content from custom sources you need to create products and repositories manually.
Red&#160;Hat repositories are signed with GPG keys by default, and it is recommended to create GPG keys also for your custom repositories.
The configuration of custom repositories depends on the type of content they hold (RPM packages, or Docker images).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Repositories configured as <code>yum</code> repositories, that contain only RPM packages, can make use of the new download policy setting to save on synchronization time and storage space.
This setting enables selecting from <strong>Immediate</strong> and <strong>On demand</strong>.
The <strong>On demand</strong> setting saves space and time by only downloading packages when requested by clients.
For detailed instructions on setting up content sources see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Content_Management_Guide/index-foreman-el.html#Importing_Content">Importing Content</a> in the <em>Content Management Guide</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A custom repository within Foreman&#160;server is in most cases populated with content from an external staging server.
Such servers lie outside of the Foreman infrastructure, however, it is recommended to use a revision control system (such as Git) on these servers to have better control over the custom content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Defining_the_Content_Life_Cycle">6.4. Content Life Cycle</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foreman provides features for precise management of the content life cycle.
A <strong>life cycle environment</strong> represents a stage in the content life cycle, a <strong>Content View</strong> is a filtered set of content, and can be considered as a defined subset of content.
By associating Content Views with life cycle environments, you make content available to hosts in a defined way (see <a href="#figu-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Red_Hat_Satellite_6_System_Architecture-Content_Life_Cycle_in_Red_Hat_Satellite_6">Content Life Cycle in Foreman</a> for visualization of the process).
For a detailed overview of the content management process see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Content_Management_Guide/index-foreman-el.html#Importing_Custom_Content">Importing Custom Content</a> in the <em>Content Management Guide</em>.
The following section provides general scenarios for deploying content views as well as life cycle environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default life cycle environment called <strong>Library</strong> gathers content from all connected sources.
It is not recommended to associate hosts directly with the Library as it prevents any testing of content before making it available to hosts.
Instead, create a life cycle environment path that suits your content workflow.
The following scenarios are common:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A single life cycle environment</strong> – content from Library is promoted directly to the production stage.
This approach limits the complexity but still allows for testing the content within the Library before making it available to hosts.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/lc_path-basic.png" alt="A single life cycle environment"></span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A single life cycle environment path</strong> – both operating system and applications content is promoted through the same path.
The path can consist of several stages (for example <strong>Development</strong>, <strong>QA</strong>, <strong>Production</strong>), which enables thorough testing but requires additional effort.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/lc_path-simple.png" alt="A single life cycle environment path"></span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application specific life cycle environment paths</strong> – each application has a separate path, which allows for individual application release cycles.
You can associate specific compute resources with application life cycle stages to facilitate testing.
On the other hand, this scenario increases the maintenance complexity.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/lc_path-diverged.png" alt="Application specific life cycle environment paths"></span></p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following content view scenarios are common:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>All in one content view</strong> – a content view that contains all necessary content for the majority of your hosts.
Reducing the number of content views is an advantage in deployments with constrained resources (time, storage space) or with uniform host types.
However, this scenario limits the content view capabilities such as time based snapshots or intelligent filtering.
Any change in content sources affects a proportion of hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host specific content view</strong> – a dedicated content view for each host type.
This approach can be useful in deployments with a small number of host types (up to 30).
However, it prevents sharing content across host types as well as separation based on criteria other than the host type (for example between operating system and applications).
With critical updates every content view has to be updated, which increases maintenance efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host specific composite content view</strong> – a dedicated combination of content views for each host type.
This approach enables separating host specific and shared content, for example you can have dedicated content views for the operating system and application content.
By using a composite, you can manage your operating system and applications separately and at different frequencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Component based content view</strong> – a dedicated content view for a specific application.
For example a database content view can be included into several composite content views.
This approach allows for greater standardization but it leads to an increased number of content views.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The optimal solution depends on the nature of your host environment.
Avoid creating a large number of content views, but keep in mind that the size of a content view affects the speed of related operations (publishing, promoting).
Also make sure that when creating a subset of packages for the content view, all dependencies are included as well.
Note that kickstart repositories should not be added to content views, as they are used for host provisioning only.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Defining_Content_Deployment">6.5. Content Deployment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Content deployment is the management of errata and packages on content hosts.
There are two methods for content deployment on Foreman; the default is <strong>remote execution</strong>, and the second is the deprecated <strong>katello agent</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote execution</strong> - Remote execution via SSH transport allows the install, update, or removal of packages, the bootstrap of configuration management agents, and the trigger of Puppet runs.
This is the preferred method for content deployment.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Foreman&#160;server has remote execution enabled by default, it is disabled by default on Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers and content hosts and has to be manually enabled.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Katello agent</strong> - Uses the <strong>goferd</strong> service which communicates to and from the Foreman server and is primarily tasked with installing and updating packages.
It is enabled and started automatically on content hosts after successfully installing the <strong>katello-agent</strong> package.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the Katello agent is deprecated and will be removed in a future Foreman version.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="sect-Automating_the_Provisioning">6.6. Provisioning</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Foreman provides several features to help you automate the host provisioning, including provisioning templates, configuration management with Puppet, and host groups for standardized provisioning of host roles.
For a description of the provisioning workflow see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Provisioning_Guide/index-foreman-el.html#provisioning-workflow_provisioning">Provisioning Workflow</a> in the <em>Provisioning Guide</em>.
The same guide contains instructions for provisioning on various compute resources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Defining_Role_Based_Authentication">6.7. Role Based Authentication</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assigning a role to a user enables controlling access to Foreman components based on a set of permissions.
You can think of role based authentication as a way of hiding unnecessary objects from users who are not supposed to interact with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are various criteria for distinguishing among different roles within an organization.
Apart from the administrator role, the following types are common:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Roles related to applications or parts of infrastructure</strong> – for example, roles for owners of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the operating system versus owners of application servers and database servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roles related to a particular stage of the software life cycle</strong> – for example, roles divided among the development, testing, and production phases, where each phase has one or more owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roles related to specific tasks</strong> – such as security manager or license manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When defining a custom role, consider the following recommendations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the expected tasks and responsibilities</strong> – define the subset of the Foreman infrastructure that will be accessible to the role as well as actions permitted on this subset.
Think of the responsibilities of the role and how it would differ from other roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use predefined roles whenever possible</strong> – Foreman provides a number of sample roles that can be used alone or as part of a role combination.
Copying and editing an existing role can be a good start for creating a custom role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider all affected entities</strong> – for example, a content view promotion automatically creates new Puppet Environments for the particular life cycle environment and content view combination.
Therefore, if a role is expected to promote content views, it also needs permissions to create and edit Puppet Environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider areas of interest</strong> – even though a role has a limited area of responsibility, there might be a wider area of interest.
Therefore, you can grant the role a read only access to parts of Foreman infrastructure that influence its area of responsibility.
This allows users to get earlier access to information about potential upcoming changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add permissions step by step</strong> – test your custom role to make sure it works as intended.
A good approach in case of problems is to start with a limited set of permissions, add permissions step by step, and test continuously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instructions on defining roles and assigning them to users, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite/index-foreman-el.html#chap-Administering-Users_and_Roles">Managing Users and Roles</a> in the <em>Administering Foreman</em> guide.

<h3 id="sect-Additional_Tasks">6.8. Additional Tasks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section provides a short overview of selected Foreman capabilities that can be used for automating certain tasks or extending the core usage of Foreman:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Discovering bare metal hosts</strong> – the Foreman Discovery plug-in enables automatic bare-metal discovery of unknown hosts on the provisioning network.
These new hosts register themselves to Foreman&#160;server and the Puppet Agent on the client uploads system facts collected by Facter, such as serial ID, network interface, memory, and disk information.
After registration you can initialize provisioning of those discovered hosts.
For details, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Provisioning_Guide/index-foreman-el.html#creating-hosts-from-discovered-hosts">Creating Hosts from Discovered Hosts</a> in the <em>Provisioning Guide</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup management</strong> – backup and disaster recovery instructions, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite/index-foreman-el.html#backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server">Backing Up Foreman&#160;server and Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server</a> in <em>Administering Foreman</em>.
Using remote execution, you can also configure recurring backup tasks on managed hosts.
For more information on remote execution see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Managing_Hosts/index-foreman-el.html#configuring-and-setting-up-remote-jobs_managing-hosts">Configuring and Setting up Remote Jobs</a> in <em>Managing Hosts</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security management</strong> – Foreman supports security management in various ways, including update and errata management, OpenSCAP integration for system verification, update and security compliance reporting, and fine grained role based authentication.
Find more information on errata management and OpenSCAP concepts in <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Managing_Hosts/index-foreman-el.html#"><em>Managing Hosts</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident management</strong> – Foreman supports the incident management process by providing a centralized overview of all systems including reporting and email notifications.
Detailed information on each host is accessible from Foreman&#160;server, including the event history of recent changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scripting with Hammer and API</strong> – Foreman provides a command line tool called Hammer that provides a CLI equivalent to the majority of web UI procedures.
In addition, you can use the access to the Foreman API to write automation scripts in a selected programming language.
For more information see the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/hammer_cli_guide/"><em>Hammer CLI Guide</em></a> and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/api_guide/"><em>API Guide</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="chap-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Deployment_Scenarios">7. Common Deployment Scenarios</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section provides a brief overview of common deployment scenarios for Foreman.
Note that many variations and combinations of the following layouts are possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Single_Location">7.1. Single Location</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <em>integrated Smart&#160;Proxy</em> is a virtual Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server that is created by default in Foreman&#160;server during the installation process.
This means Foreman&#160;server can be used to provision directly connected hosts for Foreman deployment in a single geographical location, therefore only one physical server is needed.
The base systems of isolated Smart&#160;Proxies can be directly managed by Foreman&#160;server, however it is not recommended to use this layout to manage other hosts in remote locations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Single">7.2. Single Location with Segregated Subnets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your infrastructure might require multiple isolated subnets even if Foreman is deployed in a single geographic location.
This can be achieved for example by deploying multiple Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;servers with DHCP and DNS services, but the recommended way is to create segregated subnets using a single Smart&#160;Proxy.
This Smart&#160;Proxy is then used to manage hosts and compute resources in those segregated networks to ensure they only have to access the Smart&#160;Proxy for provisioning, configuration, errata, and general management.
For more information on configuring subnets see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Managing_Hosts/index-foreman-el.html#"><em>Managing Hosts</em></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Multiple_Locations">7.3. Multiple Locations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is recommended to create at least one Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server per geographic location.
This practice can save bandwidth since hosts obtain content from a local Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server.
Synchronization of content from remote repositories is done only by the Smart&#160;Proxy, not by each host in a location.
In addition, this layout makes the provisioning infrastructure more reliable and easier to configure.
See <a href="#figu-Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Red_Hat_Satellite_6_System_Architecture-Red_Hat_Satellite_6_System_Architecture">Foreman System Architecture</a> for an illustration of this approach.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Red_Hat_Satellite-Architecture_Guide-Capsule_with_External_Services">7.4. Smart&#160;Proxy with External Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can configure a Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server (integrated or standalone) to use external DNS, DHCP, or TFTP service.
If you already have a server that provides these services in your environment, you can integrate it with your Foreman deployment.
For information about how to configure a Smart&#160;Proxy with external services, see <a href="https://docs.theforeman.org/2.5/Installing_Proxy_on_Red_Hat/index-foreman-el.html#configuring-external-services">Configuring Smart&#160;Proxy&#160;server with External Services</a> in <em>Installing an External Smart Proxy Server 2.5</em>.</p>

<h2 id="chap-Documentation-Architecture_Guide-Required_Technical_Users">Appendix A: Technical Users Provided and Required by Foreman</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the installation of Foreman, system accounts are created.
They are used to manage files and process ownership of the components integrated into Foreman.
Some of these accounts have fixed UIDs and GIDs, while others take the next available UID and GID on the system instead.
To control the UIDs and GIDs assigned to accounts, you can define accounts before installing Foreman.
Because some of the accounts have hard-coded UIDs and GIDs, it is not possible to do this with all accounts created during Foreman installation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following table lists all the accounts created by Foreman during installation.
You can predefine accounts that have <strong>Yes</strong> in the <strong>Flexible UID and GID</strong> column with custom UID and GID before installing Foreman.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not change the home and shell directories of system accounts because they are requirements for Foreman to work correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of potential conflicts with local users that Foreman creates, you cannot use external identity providers for the system users of the Foreman base operating system.</p>
